# RedAndBlackRV
Red And Black RV uses Oculus DK2 and Leap Motion to simulate a casino roulette

Abstract:

In this VR game, immerse yourself in the exciting story of a university student facing a risky decision. The protagonist decides to visit a casino to try his luck at roulette, seeking to win a large amount of money. However, the money he is betting belongs to his tuition fees. If he loses, he will be forced to drop out of his studies.

As you delve into this game, you will experience a combination of elements from real life and augmented reality. Using your special virtual reality goggles (Oculus DK2), you will be able to see the casino environment around you as you interact with the surroundings, both outside and inside the casino facilities, while participating in the action.

So, tell me, would you bet all your money on a single number and risk losing it all, or would you be more cautious and seek strategies to increase your chances of winning?
